Welcome to InfoCreep! This is a project I have been working on for a bit as a part of my continued cyber education, and if there are 
any questions I would love to answer them. As a disclaimer, I am not responsible for any malicious activity this script is used for. Your actions are your own, as I use this script strictly for LEGAL penetration testing and HackTheBox modules. This script runs a basic nmap scan for normal ports which speeds up the process and will change the commands depending on the OS type (Windows or Linux). It will perform DNS enumeration and a whois lookup as well. More development will be pushed as I decide to automate more of the recon process.
Happy hunting :)
