Welcome to InfoCreep! This is a project I have been working on for a bit as a part of my continued cyber education, and if there are 
any questions I would love to answer them. As a disclaimer, I am not responsible for any malicious activity this script is used for. Your actions are your own, as I use this script strictly for LEGAL penetration testing and HackTheBox modules. This is a complete DNS enumeration/web status tool and is perfect for people who know how these systems work and are ready to speed up their efforts when hacking more complicated machines. Development will be in phases, starting with the original http status commands and finishing with an indepth webscraper which will grab useful information such as vulnerabilities and version numbers for exploitation. Our next developmental phase involves establishing the bones of remotely using ViewDNS.info through a shell, making this a much more streamline process. We will post periodic updates as time carries on. 
Happy hunting :)
